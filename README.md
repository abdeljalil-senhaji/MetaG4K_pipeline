## 🧩 Description

Written in Snakemake, this pipeline supports the complete metagenomic analysis of Illumina short-read sequencing data. It performs dual analyses — classification and taxonomic assignment — and then synthesizes the results into a clear and concise HTML report. Task scheduling is optimized through the use of the Godocker cluster.
